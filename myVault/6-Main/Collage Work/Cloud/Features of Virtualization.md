## Container
- A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies, so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. Container images become containers at runtime.



## Linux Containers - LXC
- The Linux Containers project (LXC) is an open-source container platform that provides tools, templates, libraries, and language bindings. LXCâ€™s simple command line interface improves the user experience when starting containers. LXC offers an operating-system-level virtualization environment that can be installed on many Linux-based systems.


## Docker Containers

- A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings.
