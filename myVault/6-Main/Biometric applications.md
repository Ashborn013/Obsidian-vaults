1. Urgency 
2. Effectiveness
3. Scope 
4. Receptiveness 
5. Exclusivity 

### 1. Criminal identification.

Criminal identification is the use of biometric technologies to identify or verify the identity of a suspect, detainee, or individual in a law enforcement application

- **Exclusivity (10/10):-** Biometrics are the only technology capable of addressing the large-scale identification needs in this market. Individuals claiming false identities or maintaining multiple identities can be identified only through their biometric data. Without automated biometric identification systems, the task of identifying criminals is exceptionally difficult. This explains the maturity of the criminal identification application as compared to other biometric applications
- **Effectiveness (9/10):-** Though not error-free, biometrics have proven to be an effective solution for criminal identification. Biometrics—in particular, AFIS solutions fronted by live-scan devices—can achieve a high level of accuracy and rapid response times, and can be used to accurately identify the vast majority of individuals. The only limitation on effectiveness is the lack of environments in which the technology can currently be successfully deployed. Mobile devices are becoming available in this market but are not fully mature solutions.
- **Receptiveness (9/10)**. There is little resistance to the use of biometrics in criminal identification; it is taken as a matter of course that fingerprinting is a necessary process for identification of noncooperative individuals. Normally, receptiveness is a function of individuals’ opinions on the technology from a privacy and a cost-benefit perspective. Biometrics, in this application, are seen as a necessary technology overriding privacy concerns and warranting the expense of deployment. 
- **Urgency (8/10).** Biometric use in criminal identification applications is not always critical, as the individual may have already been adequately identified and only some percentage of individuals are held under fraudulent identities. However, there are many situations in which the ability to perform rapid searches is essential, since an identity match may be necessary to keep a suspect in custody
- **Scope (5/10).** Most individuals will never be on the receiving side of a criminal identification process, so the scope of the solution is not very broad—it exists within a circumscribed set of law enforcement applications. Although it is true that society in general derives benefits from the functionality that biometrics provide in this area, most individuals will not directly interact with biometrics on a daily basis in a criminal identification environment.

### 2. Biometrics in medicine
Biometrics in medicine refers to the use of biological data to identify individuals and enhance healthcare practices.


#### Key areas includes
1. Patient Identification
	- Biometric systems, such as fingerprint, facial recognition, and iris scans, are used to accurately identify patients. This helps prevent medical errors, such as mismatched records or wrong treatments
2. Access Control
	- Biometric authentication ensures that only authorized personnel can access sensitive medical data or restricted areas in healthcare facilities, enhancing security and privacy
3. Telemedicine
	- in telehealth applications, biometrics can verify the identity of patients during virtual consultations, ensuring secure and personalized healthcare services 
4. Drug Administration
5. Health Records Management
6. Clinical Trials
7. Wearable Devices


### Cancellable biometrics

- Cancellable biometrics refers to biometric authentication systems that allow the transformation of biometric data into a nonreversible format, enabling the data to be canceled or replaced if compromised

#### Key Features of Cancellable Biometrics
- **Transformations**: Biometric templates (e.g.,fingerprints, facial features) are transformed usingspecific algorithms to create a "cancellable" version.This process makes it difficult for attackers toreconstruct the original data. 
- **Revocability** : If a biometric biometric template template is compromised,compromised,the user can regenerate a new template using adifferent transformation, effectively "cancelling" the oldone. 
- **Enhanced Privacy:** By not storing the raw biometricdata, users retain more control over their personalinformation, mitigating risks of identity theft andmisuse.
