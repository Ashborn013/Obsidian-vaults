- **Linear discriminant analysis (LDA).** LDA aims to create new components that separate clusters based on a categorical feature. 
- **Independent component analysis (ICA).** ICA aims to retrieve original features that are mixed together in a linear combination in the input dataset. 
- **Local Feature Analysis** (LFA) LFA uses the person's facial contour lines calculated through the detection process to examine and classify line-segment types.
