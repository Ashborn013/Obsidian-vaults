## Image Processing

#### Challenges
- The core technology can account for pupil dilation, occlusion duetoeyelids, and reflections due to the acquisition camera When the pupil dilates, the iris patterns shrink and expand inanormalized fashion such that algorithms can translate a dilated verification to a nondilated enrollment

## Distinctive Features
- primary visible characteristic is known as the trabecular meshwork, a tissue that gives the appearance of dividing the iris in a radiaashion.
- rings, furrows, freckles, and the corona.


## Weakness of iris scan
- **Difficulty of Usage**: enrollment and verification require fairly precise positioning of the head and eyes. Also, users with poor eyesight and those incapable of lining up the  eye with the technologyâ€™s guidance components have difficulty using the technology
