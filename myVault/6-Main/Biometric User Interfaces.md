### Human Computer Interaction System

It is categized as the dialog or interchange btw human and computer bcz the output of one servers as the input of another 


### components of HCI 
- Human
- Computer 
- Interaction 

### what is interaction

interaction refers to the dialog generated by computer and data  , input to computer and the display , output of computer and the sensory input to human and motor response

### what is a interface
Interface is made of set of Hardware device 

### Biometrics User Interface

The task of human-machine interfaces is to present the digital form of the end user's biometrics characteristics to the computer


### BIOMETRICS HUMAN-MACHINE INTERFACE (BHMI)
is the part of a biometrics system which interacts with the end user and communicates with the host computer


### Goals of BHMI
- Producing a high-quality output for subsequent biometrics processing like verification and identification.
- Provide a user friendly & easy to use interface

### BHMI Structure

### BHMI â€“ Design Challenges

1. Feedback :
	- In some biometrics systems, feedback and human interaction is important to provide a high-quality sample to the system
2. Speed : 
	- It influences the response time of a biometrics system. It also is a factor for BHMI designer that must take inconsideration.
3. Quality : 
	- The quality of the "product" of the BHMI is a main specification of the BHMI and/or the biometrics system.




### IRIS IMAGE CAPTURING

In response to these challenges of illumination and positioning, iris 2 image-acquisition rigs have been developed

- Daugman System
- Wildes System


#### Daugman System

- It is a simple and compact system
- With a standard standard video camera Daugman system provides the end user with video feedback via a miniature liquid-crystal display placed in line with the camera's optics via beam splitter

##### Demerits in Daughman
- These light reflections cover the parts of the eye image causing hindrance in the iris detection process
- Wrong detection of pupil region in Daughman Method


#### Wildes System



### HAND GEOMETRY SENSOR
- charge coupled-device (CCD)digital camera, which with the help of a mirror captures the side and top views of the hand simultaneously.

### FINGERPRINT SENSOR
- Fingerprint biometrics examines small unique marks called minutiae on the finger image
- These minutiae may be ridge endings or ridge bifurcations
- The simplest method is the well-known ink-and-paper method paper method, which is also called the inked impression method



#### Inkless Method

- It Consists of
	1. Prism
	2. Light Source
	3. Camera

- A beam is introduced into the prism from one of its slanted surfaces This beam is arranged so as to meet the conditions for total internal reflection at the top surface of the prism.

#### Holographic Fingerprint Scanner
- To solve these problems, a variation of the prism method with a hologram was proposed
- The transparent flat glass plate has a hologram on one end and a fingerprint input section on the other end
- The light with an angle of incidence above the critical angle reflected repeatedly within the glass (total internal reflection) and is propagated glass in the same way as light that is scattered from a grooved surface.
- The repeatedly reflected light carries the image of the ridges



### Ports 

#### Serial Port vs Parallel Port 

|                                  Serial Port                                   |                                              Parallel Port                                               |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Only one data line because the data are transmitted serially one bit at a time | There will be number of datalines so each byte can be transmitted in parallel, thatis one byte at a time |
|                                  Slow Process                                  |                                                 Fast one                                                 |
|               atached to slow devices such as modems & terminals               |          parallel modules are employed with high speed devices such as magnetic tapes and disks          |
