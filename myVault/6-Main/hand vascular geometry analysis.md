# Imaging Techniques
- **Infrared Imaging**: Hand veins are captured using infrared light, which penetrates the skin and highlights the subcutaneous blood vessels. This is commonly used in biometric systems. 
- **Near-Infrared Spectroscopy** (NIRS): NIRS can be used for more detailed analysis of blood oxygenation and hemoglobin levels in the hand's vascular system. 
- **Thermography:** Thermal cameras detect the heat emitted by blood vessels, providing another method to visualize and analyze vascular patterns.
