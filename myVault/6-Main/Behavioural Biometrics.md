## Signature scan

- identifies a person based on their handwriting.
- operated in two different ways:
	- Static
	- Dynamic

### Static  Signature scan
- In this mode, users write their signature on paper, and after the writing is complete, it is digitized through an optical scanner or a camera to turn the signature image into bits
### Dynamic
- n this mode, users write their signature in a digitizing tablet, which acquires the signature in real time
- Dynamic signature verification technology uses the behavioral biometrics of a hand written signature to confirm the identity of a computer user.


## Keystroke scan

- Keystroke recognition is a behavioral biometric which utilizes the unique manner in which a person types to verify the identity of an individual.
- often called “keystroke dynamics”, refers to the detailed timing information that describes exactly when each key was pressed on a digital device and when it was released as a person types

- The raw measurements used for keystroke dynamics are known as `dwell time` and `flight time`.

- `Dwell time` is the duration that a key is pressed, while `flight time` is the duration between keystrokes

## Gait recognition
- Gait is defined as the style or manner of walking
- Gait recognition refers to the use of video of human gait, processed by computer vision methods, to recognize or to identify persons based on their body shape and walking styles.
- Gait recognition technology utilizes various sources or capture devices such as cameras, motion sensors, and others to acquire data. The collected data undergo several recognition steps.
## Gesture Recognition
- A gesture is an action that has to be seen by someone else and has to convey some piece of information.
### Glove based technique
- it utilizes a sensor attached to a glove that directly measures hand movement
### Vision based Approach
- The sensor is a camera in vision-based gesture recognition systems
- Based on feature extraction, vision-based gesture recognition systems are broadly divided into two categories, 
	- **appearance-based methods**  
		- Appearance-based methods utilize features of training image to model the visual appearance, and compare these parameters with the features of test image
		-
	- **three dimensional (3D) hand model-based methods**
		- Three dimensional model-based methods rely on a 3D kinematic model, by estimating the angular and linear parameters of the model.
